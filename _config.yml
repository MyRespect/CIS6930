course_description: " Welcome to Trustworthy AI Systems! In this course, we will cover learning-based modern AI 
Systems with exemplary topics in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech systems. Meanwhile, 
we will discuss how to design AI systems that people can trustâ€”systems that are transparent, fair, secure, 
private, robust, and capable of making decisions that positively impact society. You will develop not just 
technical expertise but also a mindset that embraces critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and a commitment 
to lifelong learning. By the end of this course, you will sharpen your problem-solving abilities by tackling 
real-world AI challenges. Your communication skills will be enhanced as you learn to explain complex technical 
concepts to diverse audiences. As we stand in a new era of AI, the need for systems that are not only intelligent 
but also reliable, ethical, and secure has never been more urgent. Let us embark on this journey together to build a 
future where AI enhances the human experience!
